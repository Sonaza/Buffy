# Buffy
Buff reminder addon for World of Warcraft

## Description
Do you find yourself forgetting to rebuff when your class buffs expire? Or do you simply want a way to tell when someone in your party is missing certain buffs you could cast?

Buffy comes to your aid and you'll never forget to buff again! Buffy tells you when a buff you can cast is missing on you or any of your party members. It looks through all the buff categories to determine which types are missing and gives recommendations accordingly. Buffy can also be configured to alert about missing party buffs while in combat so that you'll avoid embarrassing 1% wipes.

## Dependencies
Buffy uses Ace3 and LibDataBroker which are included in the /libs directory.
